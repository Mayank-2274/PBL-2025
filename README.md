# PBL2025 - Restriction Enzyme Digestion Analysis

This project provides a Python implementation for analyzing DNA sequences using restriction enzymes. It allows users to perform both single and multiple enzyme digestions on DNA sequences.

## Features

- Single enzyme digestion analysis
- Multiple enzyme digestion analysis
- Support for custom restriction enzymes
- Detailed fragment analysis
- Interactive command-line interface

## Usage

Run the script using Python:

```bash
python python.py
```

Follow the interactive prompts to:
1. Enter your DNA sequence
2. Specify restriction enzymes and their recognition sequences
3. View digestion results

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external dependencies required
